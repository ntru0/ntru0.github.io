**Hello world**, this is my first of many Jekyll blog post.

I want to document little snapshots of life I find interesting.

I have a lot of interest, ranging from art, games, books, and traveling and I thought it would be a fun idea to compile them to a personal blog.

Anyways, that's it for now.
Thanks for visiting and hope to see you guys soon!
