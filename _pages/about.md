Hello, I'm **Nhi** and I have worked as a Technical Consultant for the past year, holding several certifications in ServiceNow and Snowflake. I also have experience with Angular and maintaining and testing legacy applications. Generally, I'm always open to learn about new technologies and software.


I'm very passionate about the creating projects and working them with likeminded people.

My life's mission is to hone my crafts and inspire others.
