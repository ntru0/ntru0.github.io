Hello, I'm **Nhi Truong** and I have worked as a Technical Consultant for the past year, holding several certifications in ServiceNow and Snowflake. I also have experience with Angular and maintaining and testing legacy applications. Generally, I'm always open to learn about new technologies and software.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from George Mason University and am currently pursuing my Master's part-time.


Outside of technology, I'm passionate about creating illustrationsâ€”both for myself and others. I've both organized and participated in fan anthologies, fan events, and occasionally design art merchandise to sell.


Considering that most of my time involves coding and art, I'm very passionate about creating. 
My life's mission is to hone my crafts and inspire others.

Resume will be available upon request.
Feel free to reach out to me at **nhiiscurrently@gmail.com** or **ntruong7@gmu.edu**.

Thanks for visiting!
