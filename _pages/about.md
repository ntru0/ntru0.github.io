Hi, I'm **Nhi Truong**, a Computer Science graduate from George Mason University and I'm interested in learning about software and technology.




In addition to software, I create illustrations for myself and others. On the side, I enjoy drawing, gaming, and traveling.


My life's mission is to master my crafts and inspire others.



Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:nhiiscurrently@gmail.com) if you'd like to contact me.
